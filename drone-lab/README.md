# Drone Lab JS Scaffolding

This folder hosts modular JavaScript scaffolding for future drone-focused portfolio sections. It sketches lightweight building blocks for:

- **Visual-Inertial SLAM** — pose tracking and map updates.
- **Onboard Detection/Tracking** — detections with lightweight filters.
- **Simulation & Telemetry** — decoupled bus for feeding simulated or real sensor frames.

Each module is intentionally minimal and documented inline so you can plug it into future UI sections without rewriting core data plumbing.
