# PROJECT: NEURAL VISUALIZER

Canvas-based visualization of neural network internals with real-time token flow and attention dynamics.

**Visualize as:**
- Transformer block sections as concentric rings
- Token embeddings as orbiting particles
- Attention heads as dynamic connection networks
- Residual streams as flowing energy paths
- Logits as radiating probability clouds

**Key Features:**
- Multi-head attention visualization
- Token flow animation
- Residual connection tracking
- Layer-by-layer decomposition
- Real-time parameter inspection
