# PROJECT: LLM-MS

This system merges GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude via a routing orchestrator.

**Visualize as:**
- Entropic fog collapsing into three stable model streams
- Vector database pings shown as radial pulses
- Latency fields mapped to distance in canvas space

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent request routing
- Model-specific optimization
- Latency monitoring
- Vector database integration
